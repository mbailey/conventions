# Documentation Standards

## Documentation Requirements

- Each project should have a README.md in the root directory.
- Other directories may have a README.md in them if there are things that need explanation.
- Other docs should live under the docs/ in the Git root.
- Review docs when making changes to the project and update where appropriate.
- When creating a new doc, ensure that it is either linked to from doc in the root directory or a file linked from it.

## Markdown Standards

Markdown should follow the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification.

It's critical you always respect these Markdown rules:

- MD022/blanks-around-headings
- MD032/blanks-around-lists
- MD031/blanks-around-fences
